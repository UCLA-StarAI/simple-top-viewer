Simple Top Viewer
-----------------

This is a simple package for viewing the 'top' output of multiple machines on a single webpage.

It works as follows:

* it assumes all machines have access to the same directory (e.g. NFS mounted)
* crontab.txt contains a crontab entry that needs to be set on each monitored machine (no root required)
* stats.py is run by crontab on each machine separately, it writes the output of 'top' to a <machine>.dat file (in the shared directory)
* index.php reads all .dat files and shows an overview in HTML


This code is a dump from what has been running in [our research group](http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/) for years. Many things are configurable but currently inlined, as that is how the code grew.


How to test
-----------
* Unpack in a working folder of your (php-aware) webserver
* run ./stats.py to generate at least one .dat file
* browse to the correct location on your webserver

Improvements and patches welcome.
